# Python Decorator tutorial
Decorators are a powerful tool for getting rid of code duplication, aka following DRY principle. It also helps with standardization of code in a project without forcing developers to remember predefined snippets or patters. In this tutorial, we'll discover how to create and use them.

Another important point to note is I'm aiming for practical value of the decorators so there will be no `foo`, `bar` examples, all examples must solve real world problem and/or taken from good source.
