# LAMBDA CALCULUS
* [Lambda Calculus](http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf)
* [Functional Programming and Lambda Calculus](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~nzeh/Teaching/3136/Notes/lambda.pdf)
* Can be called the smallest universal programming language of the world.
    * It is thus equivalent to Turing machines.
    * The `Î»` calculus emphasizes the use of transformation rules and does not care about the actual machine implementing them. It is an approach more related to software than to hardware.

# CLOUD COMPUTING COURSE
* [Cloud computing course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:IEEEx+CloudIntro.x+2015T2)

## What is cloud computing
* On-demand network access to shared pool of configurable computing resources
* such as networks, servers, storages, applications and services
* Can be rapidly provision and released with minimal management effort
* NIST cloud model
    * 3 service models
    * 4 deployment models

## Why cloud computing
* Value to consumers
    * allow consumers to rent access to computing resources
    * potentially more cost-effective for small organizations
* Value to software, hardware and system vendors
    * selling expensive products to budget-concious customers

## Is cloud computing new
* Utility computing - 1961
* Time sharing - 70s
* Large distributed data centers - 80s 90s
* Internet computing 00s- today
* What's new? - better technology makes resource sharing
    * vast
    * pervasive
    * economical

## Essential Characteristics
* On demand self-service
    * consumer can self-provision computing capabilities without requiring human interaction
* Broad network access
* Resource-pooling
    * provider's computing resources are combined to serve multiple consumers
    * consumers have no control or knowledge of the exact location
* Rapid elasticity
    * capabilities can be reconfigured and scaled rapidly and/or automatically
* Measured service
    * automatically control, monitor and optimize resource utilization

## Service models (3)
* Software as a service (SAAS)
* Platform as a service (PAAS)
* Infrastructure as a service (IAAS)

## Deployment models (4)
* Private
    * can be on or off premises
* Community
    * infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by specific community that has shared concerns
    * cloud maybe owned, managed and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party or some combination of these.
    * can be on or off premises
* Public
    * on the premises of the cloud provider
* Hybrid

## Cloud Infrastructure
* Physical layer
    * hardware: server, storage, network
* Abstraction layer
    * software

## General cloud/consumer view
* Client-server model
* Cloud viewed as a grid of computer system, storage and applications
* New users may arrive, existing ones may depart
* A cloud maintains a pool of hardware resources
    * attach new hardware as needed
    * remove old or failing components
    * power off unused components
