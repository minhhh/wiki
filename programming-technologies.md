## Undefined behaviour
**[Chandler Carruth: Garbage In, Garbage Out: Arguing about Undefined Behavior...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG1OZ69H_-o)** In this talk, I'm going to try something very bold. I will try to utterly and completely do away with the use of the term "undefined behavior" in these discussions. And I will unquestionably fail. But in the process of failing, I will outline a framework for understanding the actual root issues that the software industry faces here, and try to give constructive and clear paths forward, both for programmers and the programming language

## Leak
**[CppCon 2016: Herb Sutter Leak-Freedom in C++... By Default](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfmTagWcqoE)**

## Software development attitude

## Programming Language discussion
**[The blub paradox](http://paulgraham.com/avg.html)** Great article about how powerful languages really are compared to each other and how you can work this to your advantage in a startup company.

**[Language trickery and EJB](http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/language-trickery-and-ejb)** Inspirational article about the nature of language and syntax. The author argues that eventually every language must have some sort of magic or trickery syntax. How much syntax depends on what syntax the language designers consider useful, which depends on how much they are used and how much code we can save with the new syntax.

**[The rule of the least power](http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html)** When designing computer systems, one is often faced with a choice between using a more or less powerful language for publishing information, for expressing constraints, or for solving some problem. This finding explores tradeoffs relating the choice of language to reusability of information. The "Rule of Least Power" suggests choosing the least powerful language suitable for a given purpose.

**[Language design](http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article)** How Go was designed to solve specific engineering issue for large software systems instead of academic language research.
