# DOCKER
Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.

## Building docker image
Docker images are read-only templates from which Docker containers are launched.

## Basic commands
* run a simple command and create new container
```
    docker run ubuntu /bin/bash
```
* start and stop container
```
    docker start 196691c7e0cd
    docker stop 196691c7e0cd
```
* remove old containers
```
    docker rm 5d4bdae290a4

    # remove all container
    docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```
* commit and tag
```
    docker commit 5d4bdae290a4 minhhh/test:0.1
    docker tag 5d4bdae290a4 minhhh/test
```
* build image
```
    docker build -t nginx-example .
```
## Volumes
```
    docker run -v /home/core/share:/var/www:rw -p 80:80 -d nginx-example
```

## Inspecting container

* Inspect container
```
    docker inspect fe5f199c07ed

    "Ports": { // this show mapping from container port to host's port
        "27017/tcp": [
            {
                "HostIp": "0.0.0.0",
                "HostPort": "27017"
            }
        ],
        "28017/tcp": [
            {
                "HostIp": "0.0.0.0",
                "HostPort": "28017"
            }
        ]
    },
    "Networks": {
        "bridge": {
            ...
            "Gateway": "172.17.0.1",
            "IPAddress": "172.17.0.3",
            ...
        }
    }
```

## Loggin into container
* detach from docker http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19688314/how-do-you-attach-and-detach-from-dockers-process
```
    Ctrl+p + Ctrl+q
    sudo docker exec -ti [CONTAINER-ID] bash
```

* SSH into your docker
